#. Now your Arduino IDE is ready!

.. note::
   In the event that some installations didn't work due to network issues or other 
   reasons, you can reopen the Arduino IDE and it will finish the rest of the 
   installation. The Output window will not automatically open after all installations 
   are complete unless you click Verify or Upload.
