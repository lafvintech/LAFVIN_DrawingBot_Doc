6.Testing and Verification
===========================

This section will guide you through testing your device to ensure it's working properly.

As mentioned in Chapter 2, we have already downloaded the APP. Now let's test if the machine is functioning correctly.

After installation, turn on your phone's Bluetooth, search for the robot, and connect to it. Once connected, you can start drawing.

.. attention:: 
    
    When using the app for the first time, you'll need to grant some permissions. To establish a connection with the robot, the app requires Bluetooth and location services permissions. These permissions are essential for the app's core functionality.

Please verify that you can draw, reset, and redraw normally. If not, please check the installation video to ensure everything is properly set up and all necessary permissions are granted.
