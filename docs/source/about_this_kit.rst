LAFVIN DrawingBot
-----------------

Introduction
-------------
This intelligent drawing robot kit features the Arduino Nano as its core controller, paired with an expansion board and an HC-06 Bluetooth module to support wireless control. Through three SG-90 servos, it precisely controls the movement of the robotic arm, enabling smooth drawing functions. Users can remotely control the robot's drawing actions, adjust the pen's position and posture, and experience the joy of intelligent drawing via multi-platform clients (supporting iOS and Android).

Features
----------
* Controller: Arduino Nano, stable, efficient, and easy to program
* Wireless Communication: HC-06 Bluetooth module, supporting multi-platform remote control
* Actuators: 3 SG-90 servos, providing precise control of the robotic arm's movement
* Functions:
    - Remote control of the robotic arm for drawing
